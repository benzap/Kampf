Kampf is a game developed to take advantage of a flexible
design. Speed isn't of necessity, but anything that can, should be
optimized in time.

kampf.org - includes a basic idea of what needs to be finished, and
small jots on ideas behind how to implement certain elements of the
engine, and what should be expected out of the engine.

NOTE: The org extension comes from the popular org-mode extension in
emacs

kampf_UML_diagram.dia - is a small diagram, which shows the underlying
structure. This is not concrete and will be changed if there are more
design constraints or ends up becoming inflexible for later
implementations. Runs in the program 'dia'
