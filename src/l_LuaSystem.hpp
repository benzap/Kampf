//DESCRIPTION
/*
  This is a system which calls two lua functions for the corresponding
  process() and createMessage() methods in a typical system. This will
  allow you to write systems within lua, which should speed up
  development on key pieces of the engine. This will also allow for
  more interesting ideas.
